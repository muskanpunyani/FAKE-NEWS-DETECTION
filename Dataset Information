you can create any dataset as per your choice or can download it from the internet.
My dataset was having 4 columns:
1)Number
2)Title
3)Text
4)Label (real or fake)
 The model was trained using supervised learning as we are giving labeled dataset to train and then expecting outcomes for our news.
 The code can be understood even by beginner as I have commented each line.
 The model is working with 93% accuracy.
